# ShadowsOnGlaciers
This repository provides an R script to estimate elevation changes in shaded areas of glaciers.

The input data to run the script are on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/8268976) under "data_for_R_script.zip". 

The user needs to change the path to the files in the script to successfully run the script using the input data.
